ENG 06 Final Project Up   to   now   in   ENG6,   we   have   focused   on   teaching   you   the   “how”   of   programming.   In   the   team   project   you   will   be taking   your   own   ideas   and   bringing   them   to   fruition   through   your   knowledge   of   computer   programming.   Software   development   is   rarely   a   one-person   effort,   so   the   project   will   be team-based. Teams can   be formed with   members of any section. You   can form   your   own   team   of   three.   No   other   team   size   will   be   allowed.   Only   if   strictly   needed,   the   TAs   may   form   smaller teams   or   add   members to teams. Beyond the Core part of the final project, we ask you to implement a number of special features, called Reach elements, so as to make your project different from your classmates. 
Important: We discourage the use of other Matlab code written by someone else, however, if you use it you must reference the code creator. 
Project: Card Game 
Project Description: Implement   a   MATLAB   program   of   a   card   game   of   your   team’s   choice.   You may   create   your   own    rules.   The    card   game    must    involve    more    than   two    players.   The   players   should   be   able   to   make   strategic   decisions   to win   the   game.   The   program   should   draw   cards   upon   request, apply the   rules, and score   the   game.       Each team   makes decisions   on   what   programming elements to use to interact with the   users.      Special   attention   should   be   paid to:
1.      Clarity on   how to   play the game.
2.      How the users should   interact with the   program.
3.      The   visual,   auditory   cues   and   special   effects   (e.g.   animations,   a   sound   clip   when   the   cards   are   drawn,   etc.).   You   are   allowed   to   use   simple   pictorial   representations   for   each card, for example a   King of hearts card with a   large   K   and   a   heart,   etc.
4.    The users should be able to   play   the   game with   each   other   over   the   internet.
The   implementation   of   the   card   game   should   involve   two   players   at   different   locations   using   a   keyboard or a mouse to play their turn. All   projects   should   have the   following   elements:
1.      A graphical user   interface.
2.      An animation.
3.      A sound   effect.
4.      Make use of a user-defined OOP   class   in at   least   one   programming   element.
5.      One or   more tables.
6.       The capability to play the game   between two,   or   more,   players   remotely.
7. Clearly       indicate       in       your       code and       your       video       where       these elements are implemented. In your YouTube video, please point out how you implemented some features (especially in the Core and the Reach) inside your code. What functions did you use? Did you use any data structures such as structs etc? What was challenging about implementing a certain feature and why?

Play Audio Collaboration Policy: Once the teams are formed   you   are   only   allowed   to   talk   and   collaborate   with    members    within    your    team.    Team    members      are      expected      to      equally      participate,      and   collaboratively   work   towards   the   completion   of   the   project.   Other   than   contacting   the   teaching   assistants   for   clarification,   you   may   not   seek   the   assistance   of   other   persons   to   complete   your   team's   project.   (Of course, general   discussions   about   how to   implement   a   GUI,   OOP,   and other   programming   constructs   could   be   discussed   with   other   students,   but   your   team   must   be   totally   responsible for the implementation of code used in   your   project).Grading    Criteria: The    projects   are   open   ended.   As   long   as   your   program   can   perform   the   assigned   tasks,   there   will   be   no   correct   or   incorrect   approaches.   Certainly   there   will   be   more   acceptable   and   attractive   solutions,   and   these   will   be   judged   in   comparison   with   competing   solutions submitted by your classmates.    The final project will   be   graded   in   6   parts:1. Project    proposal:       Each      team      submits      a      2-3       page      project      proposal      via      Canvas   describing   the   project   they   have   selected,   a   general   description   of   how   they   will   implement   the main components of their project, and a   clear   description   of the   Reach features   that   their team   proposes.   Essentially,   the   scope   of the   project   should   be   both   challenging   enough   to   merit full   credit   and   doable within   the   timeline. An Appendix   should   contain   a   breakdown   of   programming   tasks,   and   who   will   be   responsible   for   what,   along   with   a   timeline   that   will   meet the submission deadline   (we suggest you   make   use   of a Gantt chart..   The   expectation is   that   each   team   member   must   take   responsibility   for   a   specific   aspect   of   the   project   and   grading for each member will be adjusted accor代 写ENG 06 Final ProjectMatlab
代做程序编程语言ding to   how   the   project   tasks were   delegated   and who was   responsible   for what   aspects   of the   project.       The   more   specific   you   can   be   in   defining the   programming tasks, what functions should exist,   and   what   each   function   should   accomplish, the better. 
2. Core: Complete the basic project as   outlined   in   the   project   description.
For example:   Show whose turn   it   is to   play, an   image   background   such   as   a   green table,   an   image showing the card draw outcome, the scores,   etc
● Features of the GUI: 
○ A button to shuffle   and   draw   a   card
○         A   button to   play a   card.
○          Display scores edit fields
○       Anything   else   you   need   or want   to   add   depending   on   the   game   you   have   chosen.
3. Reach/Special Features:      Implement    the       project      enhancements      described      in    your   proposal.   Your   completion   of the   Core   and   the   creativity   of your   proposal   will   be   taken   into account during the grading   process.

4. Additional Core Requirement: Remote players and Tables with ThingSpeak: 
●         The   GUI   interface   must   include   a   table   keeping   a   record   of   the   rolls   for   each   player throughout the game.
●          The   capability to   play   the   game   between   two,   or   more,   players   remotely.
5. Youtube Video Requirements: Youtube   has several examples of ENG6 videos   (search   ENG6).   The   format   of the   video   is   entirely   up   to   your   team   as   long   as   the   following   criteria are   met:
A.      The   maximum length of the video is   10   minutes
B.      Each   team    member   must    be   seen    in   the   video   to    present   their   work    and   contributionsC.    A   clear   and   easy   to   follow   demonstration   that   shows   the   correct   functionality   of   your   program   (show   your   program   actually   working   in   the   video   –   not   screen   shots of before   and   after.)D. Use    visual    aides to help explain your steps (whiteboard, markers, poster, etc.). The video does not have to be fancy, just effective in relaying the most important information. 6. Team    Evaluations:   Each   member   must   provide   a   brief   personal   summary   of   her/his   involvement   and   contributions.       Each    team    member    is    required    to   submit   evaluations   of   her/his teammates’ contribution, one for each of   Core   and   Reach.   For   example,   if your   team   has members A,   B, C, your evaluation can   be similar to   the following   for   a   single   member.Team   Member   A:   was   in   charge   of   writing   the   code   to   execute   the   equalizer   filters.   For   the   Reach,   A   was   in   charge   of   adding   2   different   analysis   plots   that   could   show   power   spectral   density   plot   and   frequency   content   of   audio   file.   Team   Members   B,   C   agree   that   A   performed   these tasks for the project.
Project    Deadlines:Deadline   #1:       TBA: Submit the    Project    Proposal: A   team   member   must   submit   the   project   proposal.   The   proposal   needs   to   include   project   name   and   names   of   all   team   members   at   the   beginning. Only one team member   should   do   this!
The   submission   should   also   contain   an   image   of the   design   view   with   the   main   components   of   your game. The image must show the   buttons,   axes,   images,   edit fields,   etc.Deadline #2:    TBA: Submit the Core.   Each   team will   submit   all   relevant   code   files.   Each   team   will   submit   a zip file   of all the   code,   the   zip   file   will   have   the   mlapp.   and   all   .m   files,   all   .img   files   and any other files that are needed   for the   game   to   run.
The   submitted   .mlapp   GUI   must   allow   the   game   to   be   played   by   one   or   two   players   using   the   same   keyboard.
Note:   The   UI   components   for   the   remote   player   locations   and   tables   can   be   avoided   in   this   stage.Deadline   #3:       TBA: Submit the    Final Project. The   final   project   must   include   the Additional Core Requirements and the Reach/Special features: Implement tables, remote locations   and   the project extensions described   in your   proposal.Each   team   will   submit   all   relevant   coding   files,   a   link   to   Youtube   video   and   team   evaluation   materials.   Each team will submit a zip file   of   all   the   code,   the   zip   file   will   have   all   .mlapp   files,   all   .img files and any other files that   are   needed   for   the   game   to   run.   In   addition,   it   should   contain   a   PDF of the team evaluation document. The   link of the   Youtube   should   be   accessible   to   all   those   who   use the   link.
